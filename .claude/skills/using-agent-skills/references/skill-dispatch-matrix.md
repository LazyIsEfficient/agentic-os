# Skill Dispatch Matrix

## Discovery Tree

When a task arrives, identify the development phase and apply the corresponding skill:

```
Task arrives
    │
    ├── Vague idea/need refinement? ──→ idea-refine
    ├── New project/feature/change? ──→ spec-driven-development
    ├── Have a spec, need tasks? ──────→ planning-and-task-breakdown
    ├── Implementing code? ────────────→ incremental-implementation
    │   ├── UI work? ─────────────────→ frontend-ui-engineering
    │   ├── API work? ────────────────→ api-and-interface-design
    │   ├── Need better context? ─────→ context-engineering
    │   └── Need doc-verified code? ───→ source-driven-development
    ├── Writing/running tests? ────────→ test-driven-development
    │   └── Browser-based? ───────────→ browser-testing-with-devtools
    ├── Something broke? ──────────────→ debugging-and-error-recovery
    ├── Reviewing code? ───────────────→ code-review-and-quality
    │   ├── Security concerns? ───────→ security-and-hardening
    │   └── Performance concerns? ────→ performance-optimization
    ├── Committing/branching? ─────────→ git-workflow-and-versioning
    ├── CI/CD pipeline work? ──────────→ ci-cd-and-automation
    ├── Writing docs/ADRs? ───────────→ documentation-and-adrs
    └── Deploying/launching? ─────────→ shipping-and-launch
```

## Lifecycle Sequence

For a complete feature, the typical skill sequence is:

```
1. idea-refine                 → Refine vague ideas
2. spec-driven-development     → Define what we're building
3. planning-and-task-breakdown → Break into verifiable chunks
4. context-engineering         → Load the right context
5. source-driven-development   → Verify against official docs
6. incremental-implementation  → Build slice by slice
7. test-driven-development     → Prove each slice works
8. code-review-and-quality     → Review before merge
9. git-workflow-and-versioning → Clean commit history
10. documentation-and-adrs     → Document decisions
11. shipping-and-launch        → Deploy safely
```

Not every task needs every skill. A bug fix might only need: `debugging-and-error-recovery` → `test-driven-development` → `code-review-and-quality`.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Skill | One-Line Summary |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Define | idea-refine | Refine ideas through structured divergent and convergent thinking |
| Define | spec-driven-development | Requirements and acceptance criteria before code |
| Plan | planning-and-task-breakdown | Decompose into small, verifiable tasks |
| Build | incremental-implementation | Thin vertical slices, test each before expanding |
| Build | source-driven-development | Verify against official docs before implementing |
| Build | context-engineering | Right context at the right time |
| Build | frontend-ui-engineering | Production-quality UI with accessibility |
| Build | api-and-interface-design | Stable interfaces with clear contracts |
| Verify | test-driven-development | Failing test first, then make it pass |
| Verify | browser-testing-with-devtools | Chrome DevTools MCP for runtime verification |
| Verify | debugging-and-error-recovery | Reproduce → localize → fix → guard |
| Review | code-review-and-quality | Five-axis review with quality gates |
| Review | security-and-hardening | OWASP prevention, input validation, least privilege |
| Review | performance-optimization | Measure first, optimize only what matters |
| Ship | git-workflow-and-versioning | Atomic commits, clean history |
| Ship | ci-cd-and-automation | Automated quality gates on every change |
| Ship | documentation-and-adrs | Document the why, not just the what |
| Ship | shipping-and-launch | Pre-launch checklist, monitoring, rollback plan |
