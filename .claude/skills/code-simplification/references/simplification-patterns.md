# Simplification Process and Patterns

## The Simplification Process

### Step 1: Understand Before Touching (Chesterton's Fence)

Before changing or removing anything, understand why it exists. This is Chesterton's Fence: if you see a fence across a road and don't understand why it's there, don't tear it down. First understand the reason, then decide if the reason still applies.

```
BEFORE SIMPLIFYING, ANSWER:
- What is this code's responsibility?
- What calls it? What does it call?
- What are the edge cases and error paths?
- Are there tests that define the expected behavior?
- Why might it have been written this way? (Performance? Platform constraint? Historical reason?)
- Check git blame: what was the original context for this code?
```

If you can't answer these, you're not ready to simplify. Read more context first.

### Step 2: Identify Simplification Opportunities

Scan for these patterns — each one is a concrete signal, not a vague smell:

**Structural complexity:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Deep nesting (3+ levels) | Hard to follow control flow | Extract conditions into guard clauses or helper functions |
| Long functions (50+ lines) | Multiple responsibilities | Split into focused functions with descriptive names |
| Nested ternaries | Requires mental stack to parse | Replace with if/else chains, switch, or lookup objects |
| Boolean parameter flags | `doThing(true, false, true)` | Replace with options objects or separate functions |
| Repeated conditionals | Same `if` check in multiple places | Extract to a well-named predicate function |

**Naming and readability:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Generic names | `data`, `result`, `temp`, `val`, `item` | Rename to describe the content: `userProfile`, `validationErrors` |
| Abbreviated names | `usr`, `cfg`, `btn`, `evt` | Use full words unless the abbreviation is universal (`id`, `url`, `api`) |
| Misleading names | Function named `get` that also mutates state | Rename to reflect actual behavior |
| Comments explaining "what" | `// increment counter` above `count++` | Delete the comment — the code is clear enough |
| Comments explaining "why" | `// Retry because the API is flaky under load` | Keep these — they carry intent the code can't express |

**Redundancy:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Duplicated logic | Same 5+ lines in multiple places | Extract to a shared function |
| Dead code | Unreachable branches, unused variables, commented-out blocks | Remove (after confirming it's truly dead) |
| Unnecessary abstractions | Wrapper that adds no value | Inline the wrapper, call the underlying function directly |
| Over-engineered patterns | Factory-for-a-factory, strategy-with-one-strategy | Replace with the simple direct approach |
| Redundant type assertions | Casting to a type that's already inferred | Remove the assertion |

### Step 3: Apply Changes Incrementally

Make one simplification at a time. Run tests after each change. **Submit refactoring changes separately from feature or bug fix changes.** A PR that refactors and adds a feature is two PRs — split them.

```
FOR EACH SIMPLIFICATION:
1. Make the change
2. Run the test suite
3. If tests pass → commit (or continue to next simplification)
4. If tests fail → revert and reconsider
```

Avoid batching multiple simplifications into a single untested change. If something breaks, you need to know which simplification caused it.

**The Rule of 500:** If a refactoring would touch more than 500 lines, invest in automation (codemods, sed scripts, AST transforms) rather than making the changes by hand. Manual edits at that scale are error-prone and exhausting to review.

### Step 4: Verify the Result

After all simplifications, step back and evaluate the whole:

```
COMPARE BEFORE AND AFTER:
- Is the simplified version genuinely easier to understand?
- Did you introduce any new patterns inconsistent with the codebase?
- Is the diff clean and reviewable?
- Would a teammate approve this change?
```

If the "simplified" version is harder to understand or review, revert. Not every simplification attempt succeeds.

## Language-Specific Guidance

### TypeScript / JavaScript

```typescript
// SIMPLIFY: Unnecessary async wrapper
// Before
async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  return await userService.findById(id);
}
// After
function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  return userService.findById(id);
}

// SIMPLIFY: Verbose conditional assignment
// Before
let displayName: string;
if (user.nickname) {
  displayName = user.nickname;
} else {
  displayName = user.fullName;
}
// After
const displayName = user.nickname || user.fullName;

// SIMPLIFY: Manual array building
// Before
const activeUsers: User[] = [];
for (const user of users) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    activeUsers.push(user);
  }
}
// After
const activeUsers = users.filter((user) => user.isActive);

// SIMPLIFY: Redundant boolean return
// Before
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  if (input.length > 0 && input.length < 100) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
// After
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  return input.length > 0 && input.length < 100;
}
```

### Python

```python
# SIMPLIFY: Verbose dictionary building
# Before
result = {}
for item in items:
    result[item.id] = item.name
# After
result = {item.id: item.name for item in items}

# SIMPLIFY: Nested conditionals with early return
# Before
def process(data):
    if data is not None:
        if data.is_valid():
            if data.has_permission():
                return do_work(data)
            else:
                raise PermissionError("No permission")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
# After
def process(data):
    if data is None:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
    if not data.is_valid():
        raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    if not data.has_permission():
        raise PermissionError("No permission")
    return do_work(data)
```

### React / JSX

```tsx
// SIMPLIFY: Verbose conditional rendering
// Before
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    return <Badge variant="admin">Admin</Badge>;
  } else {
    return <Badge variant="default">User</Badge>;
  }
}
// After
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  const variant = user.isAdmin ? 'admin' : 'default';
  const label = user.isAdmin ? 'Admin' : 'User';
  return <Badge variant={variant}>{label}</Badge>;
}

// SIMPLIFY: Prop drilling through intermediate components
// Before — consider whether context or composition solves this better.
// This is a judgment call — flag it, don't auto-refactor.
```
