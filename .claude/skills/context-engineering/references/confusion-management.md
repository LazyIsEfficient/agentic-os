# Confusion Management

Even with good context, you will encounter ambiguity. How you handle it determines outcome quality.

## When Context Conflicts

```
Spec says:         "Use REST for all endpoints"
Existing code has: GraphQL for the user profile query
```

**Do NOT** silently pick one interpretation. Surface it:

```
CONFUSION:
The spec calls for REST endpoints, but the existing codebase uses GraphQL
for user queries (src/graphql/user.ts).

Options:
A) Follow the spec — add REST endpoint, potentially deprecate GraphQL later
B) Follow existing patterns — use GraphQL, update the spec
C) Ask — this seems like an intentional decision I shouldn't override

→ Which approach should I take?
```

## When Requirements Are Incomplete

If the spec doesn't cover a case you need to implement:

1. Check existing code for precedent
2. If no precedent exists, **stop and ask**
3. Don't invent requirements — that's the human's job

```
MISSING REQUIREMENT:
The spec defines task creation but doesn't specify what happens
when a user creates a task with a duplicate title.

Options:
A) Allow duplicates (simplest)
B) Reject with validation error (strictest)
C) Append a number suffix like "Task (2)" (most user-friendly)

→ Which behavior do you want?
```

## The Inline Planning Pattern

For multi-step tasks, emit a lightweight plan before executing:

```
PLAN:
1. Add Zod schema for task creation — validates title (required) and description (optional)
2. Wire schema into POST /api/tasks route handler
3. Add test for validation error response
→ Executing unless you redirect.
```

This catches wrong directions before you've built on them. It's a 30-second investment that prevents 30-minute rework.
