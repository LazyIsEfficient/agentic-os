# Context Packing Strategies

## The Brain Dump

At session start, provide everything the agent needs in a structured block:

```
PROJECT CONTEXT:
- We're building [X] using [tech stack]
- The relevant spec section is: [spec excerpt]
- Key constraints: [list]
- Files involved: [list with brief descriptions]
- Related patterns: [pointer to an example file]
- Known gotchas: [list of things to watch out for]
```

## The Selective Include

Only include what's relevant to the current task:

```
TASK: Add email validation to the registration endpoint

RELEVANT FILES:
- src/routes/auth.ts (the endpoint to modify)
- src/lib/validation.ts (existing validation utilities)
- tests/routes/auth.test.ts (existing tests to extend)

PATTERN TO FOLLOW:
- See how phone validation works in src/lib/validation.ts:45-60

CONSTRAINT:
- Must use the existing ValidationError class, not throw raw errors
```

## The Hierarchical Summary

For large projects, maintain a summary index:

```markdown
# Project Map

## Authentication (src/auth/)
Handles registration, login, password reset.
Key files: auth.routes.ts, auth.service.ts, auth.middleware.ts
Pattern: All routes use authMiddleware, errors use AuthError class

## Tasks (src/tasks/)
CRUD for user tasks with real-time updates.
Key files: task.routes.ts, task.service.ts, task.socket.ts
Pattern: Optimistic updates via WebSocket, server reconciliation

## Shared (src/lib/)
Validation, error handling, database utilities.
Key files: validation.ts, errors.ts, db.ts
```

Load only the relevant section when working on a specific area.
